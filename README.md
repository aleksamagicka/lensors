## Overview

This software aims to provide a GUI for showing up-to-date sensor data from the HWMON Linux subsystem.

It's currently under development, but basic features that should work are:

- Reading sensors from hwmon
- Assigning an icon to the reading for visual aid
- Tracking min and max values of a sensor
- Showing the unit value of a sensor
- Updating data every second

Ideas for the future:

- A menu with options for finer customization of presented data
- Liquidctl support
